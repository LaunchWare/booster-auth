# BoosterAuth

A TypeScript monorepo for modular, secure, and extensible authentication systems.

It is built with Node.js/TypeScript and Express, following Nx conventions for workspace management and using pnpm as the package manager.

AI is a first-order consideration in this monorepo, with agents used to scaffold, test, and iterate on new features.
