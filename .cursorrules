# Cursor Guidance for Booster Auth Monorepo

You are working in the BoosterAuth monorepo. Please read and follow the guidance in these files:

1. `.ai/shared/architectural-context.md` - Core architectural principles and patterns
2. `.ai/shared/library-prd.md` - Project overview and development philosophy

Key principles:

- All code lives in `libs/` as independently publishable npm packages
- `apps/` contains implementation examples only
- TDD-first: Generate tests before implementations
- Use TypeScript with strict mode, dependency injection, and Zod validation
- Follow security-first principles per Lucia auth patterns
- Respect architectural boundaries (no cross-dependencies without DI)
