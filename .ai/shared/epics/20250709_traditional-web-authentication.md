# Epic: Traditional Web-Based Authentication

## Overview

Implement a complete traditional web-based authentication system that enables users to securely sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts within the BoosterAuth monorepo ecosystem.

## Business Value

- **Developer Experience**: Provides a foundational authentication system that developers can easily integrate into their SaaS applications
- **Security First**: Implements industry-standard security practices following Lucia principles
- **Modularity**: Allows developers to pick and choose authentication components as needed
- **Time to Market**: Reduces development time for teams needing secure authentication
- **Compliance**: Meets security standards required for enterprise SaaS applications

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can successfully sign up with email and password
- [ ] Users can sign in with valid credentials
- [ ] Users can securely sign out and invalidate sessions
- [ ] Users can reset forgotten passwords via email
- [ ] All authentication flows are secure and follow best practices
- [ ] System prevents enumeration attacks
- [ ] Password policies are configurable
- [ ] All packages are independently publishable and testable

## Architectural Considerations

### Package Structure

Following the monorepo philosophy, authentication functionality will be distributed across multiple packages in `libs/`:

- **Core Interfaces** (`@booster-auth/core`): Abstract interfaces and types only
- **Session Management** (`@booster-auth/session`): Session creation, validation, and lifecycle
- **Identity Management** (`@booster-auth/identity`): User identity and credential management
- **Password Management** (`@booster-auth/password-authentication`): Password hashing, validation, and reset
- **Email Services** (`@booster-auth/email`): Email provider abstraction and templates

### Security Principles

- **No Opaque Abstractions**: Clear, explicit session control
- **Secure Defaults**: bcrypt password hashing, secure session storage
- **Configurable Security**: Customizable password policies and session timeouts
- **Protection Against Attacks**: Enumeration attack prevention, token expiration

### Dependency Injection

- Core services (`SessionService`, `IdentityService`, `PasswordService`) receive dependencies via constructor injection
- No tight coupling to Prisma in core logic
- Pluggable strategies for different authentication methods

### Testing Strategy

- TDD-first approach: tests generated before implementations
- Unit tests in `__tests__` subdirectories with `*.test.ts` suffix
- Each library independently testable
- Comprehensive coverage of security scenarios

## Technical Requirements

### Data Layer

- **User Accounts**: User accounts with email, hashed passwords, metadata
- **Session Storage**: Secure session tokens with expiration
- **Password Reset Tokens**: Temporary, single-use tokens with TTL
- **Audit Logging**: Authentication events for security monitoring

### API Contracts

- **Zod Schema Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety across all packages
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses that don't leak information
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Integration Points

- **Email Provider Abstraction**: Support for SMTP, SendGrid, Postmark
- **Database Abstraction**: Prisma integration without tight coupling - consider how drizzle can similarly be used
- **Middleware Integration**: Express middleware for session validation

## User Flows Covered

### 1. User Sign Up

- Email and password validation
- Password hashing and secure storage
- Account creation with proper error handling
- Welcome email (optional)

### 2. User Sign In

- Credential validation without enumeration
- Session creation and token generation
- Secure session storage
- Failed attempt handling

### 3. User Sign Out

- Session invalidation
- Token cleanup
- Secure logout confirmation

### 4. Password Reset Flow

- Reset request with email validation
- Secure token generation and email delivery
- Password reset with token validation
- Token invalidation after use
- Confirmation email after reset

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Session validation in < 100ms
- Password hashing optimized for security vs. performance
- Efficient token lookup and validation

### Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (configurable rounds)
- Session tokens cryptographically secure
- Protection against timing attacks
- Secure token expiration and cleanup

### Scalability

- Stateless session validation
- Horizontal scaling support
- Database connection pooling
- Rate limiting and abuse protection

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Hashing**: bcrypt (configurable)
- **Database**: Prisma (PostgreSQL preferred)
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive coverage

### External Dependencies

- Email service providers (SMTP, SendGrid, Postmark)
- Database for persistent storage
- Redis for session storage (optional)
- Rate limiting service (optional)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Security Risks

- **Risk**: Password brute force attacks
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, account lockout, secure password policies

- **Risk**: Session hijacking
- **Mitigation**: Secure token generation, HTTPS only, proper expiration

- **Risk**: Enumeration attacks
- **Mitigation**: Consistent response times, generic error messages

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Package dependency complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear interfaces, dependency injection, independent testing

- **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks
- **Mitigation**: Efficient algorithms, caching, performance monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- All user flows work end-to-end
- Security measures prevent common attacks
- Error handling provides appropriate feedback
- Email delivery is reliable and configurable

### Technical

- All packages pass independent tests
- Code coverage > 90%
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security audit passes
- Documentation complete

### Architectural

- Dependency injection properly implemented
- No cross-package dependencies without DI
- Interfaces clearly defined in core packages
- Modular design allows independent usage

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories completed and tested
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples in `apps/` directory functional
- [ ] All packages independently publishable
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing
- [ ] Ready for beta testing with real applications
